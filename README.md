## Usage
This is the back-end of a fictional social media application so to test it out yourself, you would need to go to the project's [repository](https://github.com/spaghettimedic/thinkr), clone the files, install its dependencies with "npm i" in your terminal pointed at the root of the project, and use an application like Insomnia to test the API routes. The following videos are a walk-through demonstration of just that:
